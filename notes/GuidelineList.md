# Guideline 1: Understand the Importance of Software Design
* Focus less on C++ language details and more on software design
* Understand software design as the art of managing dependencies and abstractions
# Guideline 2: Design for Change
* Adhere to the Single-Responsibility Principle (SRP) to separate concerns
* Follow the Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle to minimize duplication.
# Guideline 3: Separate Interfaces to Avoid Artificial Coupling
* Adhere to the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) to separate concerns in interfaces.
* Consider the ISP as a special case of the Single-Responsibility Principle (SRP).
